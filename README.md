# trading-bot-sstem
This project consists of implementing an algorithmic trading bot in python. This bot will be able to use the currency available within the used account, acquire data given, and make a strategic decision to buy or sell to gain profit. Important note: Credentials will not be put into this public repository. Bot will run locally. S-STEM collaborators include Emma Allen, Abdel Issa, and Daniel Avila.
